# phpLDAPadmin
phpLDAPadmin is a web based LDAP data management tool for system administrators. It is commonly known and referred by many as "PLA".

PLA is designed to be compliant with LDAP RFCs, enabling it to be used with any LDAP server.
If you come across an LDAP server, where PLA exhibits problems, please open an issue with full details of the problem so that we can have it fixed.

For up to date information on PLA, please head to the [wiki](https://github.com/leenooks/phpLDAPadmin/wiki).

## Found a bug?
If you have found a bug, and can provide detailed instructions so that it can be reproduced, please open an [issue](https://github.com/leenooks/phpLDAPadmin/issues) and provide those details.

Before opening a ticket, please check to see if it hasnt already been reported, and if it has, please provide any additional information that will help it be fixed.

*TIP*: Issues opened with:

* including (if appropriate) an LDIF with the data that exhibits the problem, 
* a patch (or a git pull request) to fix the problem

will be looked at first :)
